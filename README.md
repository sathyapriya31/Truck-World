### Sample app to demo fragment usage with WizarDroid

* You can download the [APK](https://dl.testfairy.com/download/64TK0D1K68WJTCSM74V3GDSP5MZXKCZZNBB7GHEBS2NDR758J2Y2N2BT3R/Truck_App-testfairy.apk) to see how it works.
* The app got four view built using wizdroid with 4 different fragment and xml's in the same activity.
* We took the concept from [WizarDroid](https://github.com/Nimrodda/WizarDroid)
* To add fun, on the first fragment we **consumed the JSON data from the API https://spritleapi.herokuapp.com/trucks.json**
